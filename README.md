# Cinema_Room_REST_service
Back-End project where one can manage buying, returning of tickets with UUID implementation and creation of REST APIs. Mainly used Java and Spring Boot

A simple implementation of Virtual Cinema Theater. It is based on Spring Boot and built with Intellij IDEA.

About
Always wanted to have your private movie theater and screen only the movies you like? You can buy a fancy projector and set it up in a garage, but how can you sell tickets? Having a booth is old-fashioned, so let's create a special service for that! Make good use of Spring and write a REST service that can show the available seats, sell and refund tickets, and display the statistics of your venue. Pass me the popcorn, please!

Learning outcomes
In this project, I learned how to create a simple Spring REST service that will help you manage a small movie theatre. Handle HTTP requests in controllers, create services and respond with JSON objects.
